# 003. BSL 1.1 license

**Status:** Accepted (updated from Apache 2.0)

## Context

DiffGuard needs a license that:

- Protects the project's commercial viability
- Allows free use for non-production purposes
- Converts to open source after the change date
- Is clear and well-understood in the industry

Options considered:

- **MIT** — simple, but no protection against competitors
- **AGPL** — copyleft scares enterprise adopters and acquirers
- **Apache 2.0** — permissive, but allows unrestricted commercial forking
- **BSL 1.1** — source-available with time-delayed open-source conversion

## Decision

BSL 1.1. Balances openness with sustainability.

## Consequences

- **Source available** — anyone can read, learn from, and contribute to the code
- **Non-production use is unrestricted** — development, testing, evaluation are all fine
- **Commercial protection** — competitors can't simply rebrand and sell
- **Time-delayed open source** — code converts to a permissive license after the change date
- **Trade-off:** Some organizations have policies against BSL — but the conversion clause mitigates long-term concerns
